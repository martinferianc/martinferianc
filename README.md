I am a penultimate-year PhD student passionate about machine learning and Bayesian neural networks at UCL with hands-on experience from industrial/academic placements in different countries. My main expertise has revolved around convolutional neural networks and their hardware acceleration applied to computer vision tasks. I am a practical researcher with an engineering background ready to apply my diverse skillset in industry.
